## Project Overview
Smart Home Management is a mobile application that allows users to manage their smart home devices. The application provides a platform where users can view and control the status of devices connected to their homes, aiming to simplify smart home device management and enhance user comfort.

## Expectations
- Provide a user-friendly interface for managing various smart home devices.
- Enable users to switch between different homes and manage devices in each home.
- Allow users to invite others to manage their homes.

## Pages

### Home Page
The Home Page provides quick access to all devices by categorizing them into three sections:
- **Doors:** Door security sensors and locks.
- **Windows:** Window security sensors.
- **Lights:** Smart lights.

From this page, users can easily view and control all devices, making it the central hub for managing their smart home setup.
